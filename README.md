# Employee Tracker

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create an employee tracket to view employees, their roles, and departments.
- I built this project to further utilize knowledge of mySQL and Inquirer.
- This code is effective in keeping track of employees and their roles in a table form.
- Composing this task scheduler, I learned how to effectively utilize mySQL and Inquirer to a higher degree.
